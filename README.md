## About the project
This C# image processing application is designed to offer users a versatile tool for manipulating images. The program begins by allowing users to load an image file of their choice. The loaded image undergoes a conversion process to transform it into a grayscale format, facilitating subsequent processing steps.

One of the key features of the application is the implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm. This algorithm categorizes similar pixels, effectively grouping colors in the image. This aids in highlighting distinct patterns and areas of interest within the visual content.

The application also provides a histogram analysis tool, offering users insights into the distribution of pixel intensities. This statistical representation enables users to understand the overall contrast and brightness characteristics of the image.

Sobel edge detection is another integral component of the application. This algorithm emphasizes edges in the image, enhancing visibility of structures and boundaries. This feature is particularly useful for users interested in detecting and analyzing detailed features within the image.

Additionally, the application supports the display of processed images in both binary and grayscale formats. Users can switch between these formats to observe the visual impact of different processing techniques.

In summary, this C# image processing application integrates fundamental algorithms like K-Means clustering and Sobel edge detection, providing users with a comprehensive set of tools to analyze and manipulate images. The intuitive interface enhances user experience, making it accessible for both beginners and those with more advanced image processing needs.
